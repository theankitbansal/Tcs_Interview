TCS NQT Technical Interview Questions: Freshers and Experienced

1. Name the pillars of Object-Oriented Programming. Is C++ an Object-Oriented programming language? Is C++ a purely object-oriented programming language?
The 4 pillars of object-oriented programming are encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism. 

Abstraction: Abstraction means hiding the details from the user. For instance, when we build any application, we only let the user interact with it using buttons. We never let the user know what happens behind the clicks of the buttons.
Encapsulation: As the name suggests, this means encapsulating different kinds of data into a single entity. For instance, when we make a class, we encapsulate the data and member functions into that single class.
Inheritance: When a class inherits from another class, it shares the properties of the first class. For example, if we make a Student class, it inherits the class People as a student have all the properties of People like a student walks, talks, etc., and apart from it, the Student has its own properties like enrollment number, subjects, etc.
Polymorphism:: The word “poly” means many and the rod “morph” means form. This means that polymorphism means showing many forms. Polymorphism can be run-time or compile-time. Examples of polymorphism are function overloading and function overriding.
Yes, C++ is an Object-Oriented programming language as we can create classes and objects and C++ can implement all the 4 pillars of OOPS. However, C++ is not a purely object-oriented programming language. This is because a purely object-oriented programming language is such a language where all the functions are written inside a class and there are no primitive data types. Everything is an object in a pure object-oriented programming language.
